Story_Text	You are a Knight, an Angel, and a Wizard, but not at the same time. You didn't have the EXP or connections to get into the good RPGs, so you're starting at this one. The costumes are obvious hand-me-downs and the work is unpaid. It's also a virtual setting, and there's no one else to co-star with.\nYour quest is to beat up any enemies that look at you the wrong way. That NPC gave you a rock and a turnip to start with, but you didn’t remember that fact. Turns out that all the budget went into the gameplay and nothing in the game makes any cents.\nAnyways, you must roll with the punches and work with whatever they gave you. And if all else fails, you can blame it on lag, your parents, and that really cute cat.

Tutorial	Tutorial
Tutorial_10	This is a turn-based RPG where you're given random Abilities to fight against random Enemies.
Tutorial_20	You always have the same 3 party members. Right click on the Knight to see what they do.
Tutorial_30	Here's your first Enemy. Use the Knight's Ability against them.
Tutorial_40	The Ability you used has a Cooldown, so you can't use it again this round. Instead use the other Ability
Tutorial_50	You killed your first Enemy! Now you may have noticed your Knight is Angry.
Tutorial_51	Everyone begins with a random Emotion. Emotions are effective against other Emotions, and have their own side effects.
Tutorial_52	Happy beats Angry, which beats Sad, which beats Happy. Neutral is neutral against everything else.
Tutorial_53	Your Knight is Angry, which means they get +1 Power (attacks and healing abilities are stronger by 1 point) and +1 Defense (take 1 less damage).
Tutorial_54	However, if they kill someone (like right now), or heal someone to full Health, they'll get Stunned and miss their next turn.
Tutorial_60	Here's your 2nd party member. Right click on the Angel to read what they do.
Tutorial_70	This Page is Happy. Happy is super effective against Angry (will deal an extra 2 damage), which puts your Knight at a disadvantage.
Tutorial_71	Normally Knight would take their turn before Angel would. But they're Stunned right now.
Tutorial_72	So instead, use the Angel’s Ability to heal the Knight.
Tutorial_80	Your Angel is Happy, which means they can use another Ability when they don't attack, but all their Abilities have 1 more turn of Cooldown.
Tutorial_81	Emotions also apply to Enemies. If you right click the Page, you'll see that their Ability got placed on Cooldown.
Tutorial_82	Your Angel didn’t attack, so they now can use another Ability. However, Assist is on Cooldown.
Tutorial_83	Instead, you can change the Page’s Emotion to Sad. That way, your Angry Knight will gain the advantage.
Tutorial_90	Everyone is either Grounded or Elevated. Your Knight always starts Grounded, and Angel always starts Elevated.
Tutorial_91	One of the Knight's big weaknesses is that they have no way to attack Elevated Enemies.
Tutorial_100	And now, your 3rd party member. Right click on the Wizard to read what they do.
Tutorial_110	Your Wizard has an Ability that forces all Elevated Enemies to be Grounded. Use Stalactites against the 2 Crows.
Tutorial_120	Your Wizard is Sad, which means every time they attack, they gain 2 Health. But if they don't attack, they lose 2 Health.
Tutorial_121	For your convenience, attacking Abilities are colored red, healing Abilities are colored green, the others are colored blue.
Tutorial_130	You can always remind yourself of what each Emotion does by opening the Emotion Guide (usually it's at the bottom right of the screen).
Tutorial_140	Anyways, now that all the Enemies are Grounded, your Knight is capable of hitting them, so finish them off.
Tutorial_150	You’ve completed the tutorial. In the main game, your 3 party members get 6 random Abilities.
Tutorial_151	To win, you'll have fight off 5 waves of random Enemies, with more powerful ones later on. Glhf!
Tutorial_Finished	Tutorial finished.
